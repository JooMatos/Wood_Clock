The harware documents stay in /hardware;

Install libraries in ARDUINO IDE for include in you ESP-32, all available in /library;

APK for your smartphone is in /APP. It needs an Android version newer than 5.1; You can download by clicking here: https://github.com/JooMatos/Wood_Clock/raw/main/APP/Relogio_APP.apk

To reprogram the ESP-32 using the Arduino IDE it is necessary to add extra boards to the IDE, this link may be useful: https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json

After adding the extra boards it will be possible to upload sketches to the ESP-32, but configuration is required before uploading the partiton scheme for "NO OTA", skipping this procedure will make run out of memory for the sketch.
